# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
_Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Java. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy even for non-programmers._

In this project we will take advantage of this Framework for test automation and will be used to test the different components of the volotea page: "https://www.volotea.com/es/". :alien:
